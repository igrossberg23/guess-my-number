# Guess My Number

This is a **single player guessing game**. This project was created as part of [The Complete Javascript Course  2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by *Jonas Schmedtmann*.

The majority of the HTML/CSS foundation was developed by the course instructor. The Javascript was written by me alongside the instructor as part of the course.

### How to play:

- Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the box. Select *Check* to see if your guess is correct
- The game will let you know if the guess is *too high*, *too low* or *correct*
- Each guess decrements the score by 1
- Play over and over to achieve a high score!
